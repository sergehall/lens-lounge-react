# React Learning Project

## Description
This project is part of my journey to learn and master **React.js**, a popular JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces. It has been bootstrapped with **Create React App** to streamline the setup process and focus on learning key React concepts and features.

## Key Learning Goals
- **Understanding React Basics**: Components, JSX, props, and state management.
- **Building Interactive UIs**: Handling user events, conditional rendering, and component lifecycle.
- **State Management**: Managing local and global state using hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
- **Component Reusability**: Structuring reusable and modular components for efficient development.
- **Routing**: Implement client-side navigation using **React Router** for single-page applications (SPAs).
- **Handling API Requests**: Use tools `fetch` or `Axios` or **React Query** to make asynchronous API requests and manage external data in the app.
- **Performance Optimization**: Explore React’s virtual DOM and optimize performance with techniques like memoization (**React.memo**), lazy loading, and code splitting.
- **Form Management**: Learn how to manage form state and validation using libraries like **Formik** or **React Hook Form**.
- **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Understand the basics of **TypeScript** for type safety in React components.

## Tools & Technologies
- **React.js**: Core library for building the app.
- **Yarn Berry / npm**: Package managers used for handling dependencies.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed **JavaScript** for better development experience and code quality.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript features such as arrow functions, destructuring, and **async/await**.
- **Create React App / Vite**: Tools for quickly setting up a modern React project.
- **React Router**: Library for handling navigation and routing in SPAs.
- **Axios / Fetch**: Libraries for making API requests.
- **React Query**: A tool for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization with external data sources.
- **Redux / Zustand / Recoil**: State management libraries for managing global state beyond React’s built-in hooks.
- **Styled Components / CSS Modules / Tailwind CSS**: Tools for styling components in a modular, scoped, or utility-first manner.
- **Webpack / Vite**: Module bundlers to streamline development and optimize builds.
- **React Testing Library / Jest**: Tools for testing React components and logic.
- **ESLint / Prettier**: Code quality and formatting tools to ensure consistency and prevent errors in your codebase.
- **Storybook**: Tool for building and testing UI components in isolation.


This project serves as a hands-on learning experience while building real-world projects and preparing for more advanced React development concepts.
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
